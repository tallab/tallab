# Welcome to the TalLab GitHub

The TalLab is a research group located at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. 
We are studying whether host-associated microbiota modify the toxicokinetics and/or toxicodynamics of chemical exposures in zebrafish 
with a particular focus on the establishment of microbial-dependent neurobehavioral signaling during development.

We also investigate mechanisms by which exposures to environmental chemicals cause hyperactivity in zebrafish. We apply a combination of 
zebrafish automated behavioral tests, RNA sequencing, 16S rRNA sequencing, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to illuminate chemical/microbiota interactions and solve 
adverse outcome pathways in vivo.

Here you can find codes and programs we have written and published which can be used for zebrafish research.
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
